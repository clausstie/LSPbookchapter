==============

This repository holds the text and associated images I produced during the writing of 
my chapter in the book "Open source software in life science research: 
Practical solutions to common challenges in the pharmaceutical industry and beyond".

The publisher has accepted that I make the unedited content publicly available under a CC license. 
"Unedited" mean that what you see here is my text and my images without any editing or polishing from Woodhead Publishing.

Here is a link to the book where the text was first published: http://www.woodheadpublishing.com/en/book.aspx?bookID=2830


With the hope that it may be of value
